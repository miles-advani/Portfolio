          "The primary goal of this project was to practice JavaScript and explore Node APIs. However, the inspiration for Terminal Toolbox came from a unique personal need.",
          "Working on a Mac with a small screen size, I prefer to keep my workspace uncluttered by hiding the upper and bottom menu bars. This means the system clock isn't always visible. As a developer, I spend a significant amount of time in the terminal, so I thought, why not bring the clock to the terminal?",
          "This led to the creation of Terminal Toolbox, starting with a simple feature to display the current time. The project has since grown, incorporating a variety of tools to enhance productivity and add a touch of fun to the terminal experience."

        "header": "Overcoming Development Challenges",
        "content": [
          "One of the challenges I faced during the development of Terminal Toolbox was a circular dependency error. This occurred when I tried to implement a 'Go Back' option in the calculator module that would return the user to the main app manager. The problem was that the calculator module was dependent on the app manager module, and vice versa, creating a circular dependency. This is a common issue in Node.js when two or more modules depend on each other, either directly or indirectly.",
          "To solve this problem, I used a callback function. Instead of directly importing the app manager module into the calculator module, I passed the `startApp` function (which starts the app manager) as a callback function to the `startCalculator` function. This way, when the user chooses to go back, the `startApp` function is invoked, taking the user back to the main app manager. This solution effectively broke the circular dependency, allowing the modules to function as expected."

        "content": [
          "One of the key improvements planned for the future of Terminal Toolbox is to refactor the codebase from CommonJS to ES6 syntax.",
          "Currently, the project uses `require()` for importing modules, which is the CommonJS way. However, ES6 introduced a new syntax for importing and exporting modules using `import` and `export` keywords. The ES6 syntax is more readable and offers more flexibility. It allows for importing and exporting individual functions, objects, or values, which can help in optimizing the code.",
          "This refactoring will involve updating all the `require()` calls to `import` statements and changing `module.exports` to `export`. While Node.js has traditionally used CommonJS, it has been increasingly supporting ES6 modules, making this a viable and future-proof improvement for the project."
